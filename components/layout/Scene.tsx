/*
 * SCENE — one stacked full-screen frame.
 *
 * ── The architecture, and why it is shaped this way ────────────────────
 *
 * A Scene renders a `.wrap` containing two children:
 *
 *   <div class="hold">   position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100svh; z-index: n
 *   <div class="runway"> pure scroll distance, for scroll-driven interiors
 *
 * `.wrap` is a plain, unpositioned block — it exists only to give each
 * scene's own hold+runway pair a shared containing block, so the hold
 * un-sticks once ITS OWN runway has scrolled past (the standard
 * "sticky-within-a-bounding-parent" pattern). Without that shared parent, a
 * sticky hold's stuck range is bounded only by <main> itself: harmless on
 * desktop, where every later scene is ALSO sticky and visually covers the
 * ones behind it — but on mobile, where most scenes release to normal flow
 * (see the `keepOnMobile` note below), a `keepOnMobile` hold would never get
 * covered again and would stay pinned over every section after it.
 *
 * Within one `.wrap`, hold and runway stay siblings (not nested one inside
 * the other): a sticky element is released the instant its own containing
 * block runs out, so the hold correctly stays pinned across its full runway
 * and lets the NEXT scene's hold — a later sibling with a higher z-index and
 * an opaque background — rise up from the bottom and cover it.
 *
 * That is the whole effect: the outgoing frame does not move, the incoming
 * frame slides up over it. It is native sticky driven by native scroll, so
 * it is perfectly scrubbable — stop halfway and the incoming frame stays
 * halfway across, to the pixel. Nothing is timed; nothing can snap or jump.
 *
 * `runway` is extra scroll distance (in viewport heights) for scenes whose
 * interior is scroll-driven: tunnel travel, journey chapters, the card arc,
 * the decks, the drift wall. Those sections scrub against their own trigger
 * over that distance and must NOT use ScrollTrigger `pin: true` — the sticky
 * hold already pins them, and two pinning mechanisms fight.
