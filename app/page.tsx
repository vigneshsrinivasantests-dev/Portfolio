/*
 * THE STACK.
 *
 * Every frame is a Scene: a runway that owns scroll distance, holding a
 * sticky full-screen stage. Scenes are painted in ascending order, so the
 * next one rises from the bottom of the viewport and COVERS the one before
 * it — the previous frame stays put behind it rather than scrolling away.
 * Native sticky does the work, so the movement is exactly scrubbable: stop
 * halfway and the incoming frame stays halfway across.
 *
 * `runway` is the extra scroll length a scene needs for its interior to play
 * (tunnel travel, chapters, the card arc, the decks, the drift wall). A scene
 * with no runway is a single held frame that the next one covers straight
 * away.
 *
 * Connect is last and deliberately NOT a Scene: it is taller than the
 * viewport and ends the page, so it rises over the Gallery and then scrolls
 * naturally into the footer.
